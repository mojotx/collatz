# Collatz Conjecture

## Overview

From Wikipedia: [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)

> The Collatz conjecture is a famous unsolved mathematical problem. Ihe conjecture
asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform
every positive integer into 1. It concerns sequences of integers in which each
term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is
even, the next term is one half of the previous term. If the previous term is
odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that
these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to
start the sequence.
>
> It is named after mathematician Lothar Collatz, who introduced the idea in 1937,
two years after receiving his doctorate. It is also known as the 3n + 1 problem,
the 3n + 1 conjecture, the Ulam conjecture (after Stanis≈Çaw Ulam), Kakutani's
problem (after Shizuo Kakutani), the Thwaites conjecture (after Sir Bryan
Thwaites), Hasse's algorithm (after Helmut Hasse), or the Syracuse problem.
The sequence of numbers involved is sometimes referred to as the hailstone
sequence, hailstone numbers or hailstone numerals (because the values are
usually subject to multiple descents and ascents like hailstones in a cloud),
or as wondrous numbers.

This is my toy code for playing with the problem, written in
[Go](https://go.dev/).
